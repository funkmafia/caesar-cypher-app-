# 🏦 Caesar Cypher App — Pretend Bank Encoder

A simple web application that encodes and decodes pretend bank messages using the classic Caesar Cipher encryption technique.

Built using **Test Driven Development (TDD)** principles with **Jest** testing framework.

---

## 📚 Features

- Accepts user input: message, shift key, and action (encode/decode)
- Encodes plain text into secret bank messages
- Decodes encrypted messages back into plain text
- Built with clean JavaScript
- Responsive dark-themed UI using TailwindCSS
- Red → Green → Refactor TDD cycle demonstrated with Git commits

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- TailwindCSS
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- Jest (JavaScript testing framework)
- Git + GitHub for version control

---

## 🧪 TDD Testing Workflow

- Initial failing test created (`RED`)
- Cipher function built to pass the test (`GREEN`)
- Code cleaned and refactored after passing (`REFACTOR`)

Commit history clearly shows TDD cycle!
